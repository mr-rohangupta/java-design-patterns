**Factory Pattern**

**Factory Pattern just define an interface and or abstract class for creating an object but let the
subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

In short subclasses are responsible to create instance of the class.**

**_In the given example we have an abstract class HeadPhones which have three concrete implementations
JBL,Sony and Boat._**

**_We have a factory class HeadPhoneFactory to generate object of concrete classes like JBL,Sony and Boat._**

**Builder Pattern**

**Builder pattern is an alternative way to construct complex objects.**

**Builder Pattern also solves the issue with large number of optional parameters and inconsistent
state by providing a way to build the object step by step and provide a method that will actually 
return the final object.**

**_In this example I had created a Pizza class with another static class Builder in it._**

**_Builder class has a build method which will give you the Pizza object._**
